One thing I learned from the Career Center presentation is that open-ended questions are very much so preferable over yes-or-no questions. Building meaningful business relationships involves a mutual exchange of information, and simple yes/no questions that can be answered by simple research doesn't really cut it. As for what I will be working on regarding my career development, I am going to work on being more confident and avoiding stuttering or filler words. I think I get a bit too reflective whenever I'm in a conversation with someone important, and then the rest of my brain lacks the capacity to put together meaningful dialogue.
